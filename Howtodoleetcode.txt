P - Did on my own without looking anything 
F - Could not do it on my own

1. Look at the constraint , it is important my boi
2. Try to understand the question with bruteforce technique
3. The most important thing is to come up with the correct efficient data structures
4. Think about the solution for 30 , 45 mins or 1 hour
5. If you cannot solve , look for small hints 
6. If it does not work , look for the solution but not code
7. If you still dont understand , see the explantion video
8. If it does not work also , finally look at the code 
9. Think of the algorithm with the desired complexity if the solution looks easy with bruteforce
